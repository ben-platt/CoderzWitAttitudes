## Island Survival Game
For our final project, we decided to make an Island Survival Game. The goal of the game is to stay alive in an island setting as long as possible, where many things challenge one’s survival. The game will ask the user to do different things, such as forage for sources of food, water, shelter, and other resources. The program will keep track of time, and many other factors will determine the player’s survival, such as natural disasters, predators, and onset of health problems. Some GUI/processing will be implemented.
